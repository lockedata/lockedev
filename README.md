Guidelines and metadata for all Locke Data packages

TODO

* Create CONTRIBUTING.md using [this model](https://github.com/lockedata/datasauRus#contributing-to-the-package)

* Create a set of issues labels. With emojis, and aligning the help wanted one with the one that GitHub recognizes and puts in people' feeds (this repo needs help on blabla issues)

* Use repostatus badges and CRAN badges (one? even more by repo) in all repos.

* Add Locke Data as funder in DESCRIPTION for all packages.

* Create a codemeta.json for each package, and merge them together here.
